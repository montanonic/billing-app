    preferredEmail EmailId -- the email that the user would prefer to be

InvoiceProfile
    userId UserId

    displayName Text -- the visible name of the Profile; this is what renders on
      -- the website, whereas 'name; is internal.

    name Text -- lowercase 'displayName'; used to prevent creation of Profiles
      -- with identical names, just different cases.

    searchTerms (Set Text) -- the terms used to find billable times for this
      -- client by searching the calendar for them

    hourLimit Int Maybe -- Hour limit notification. Tells the app when to notify
      -- you that you've reached the given number of hours

    -- howToNotify [NotifyBy] Maybe -- used in conjuction with hourLimit. Uses
      -- a Haskell sum type that contains all the possible options for a user
      -- to receive notifications. A user can select more than one notification
      -- type if they would like.

      -- where the person travelled to and from, and justify the expense

      -- hours the user would bill the client for, for calendar events marked
      -- "all day", which blocks out an entire day and doesn't specify hours.
      -- defaults to 8 hours. The user can set their own default in their
      -- profile.

      -- user can write in calendar markup language the specific amount of hours
      -- to bill for in the event's description as well.

CalendarEvent
    kind Text -- ^ Type of the resource ("calendar#event").
    etag Text -- ^ ETag of the resource.
    ident Text -- (`id`) ^ unique event identifier
    htmlLink Text -- ^ An absolute link to this event in the Google
      -- Calendar Web UI.
    created UTCTime -- ^ Creation time of the event (as a RFC3339
      -- timestamp).
    updated UTCTime -- ^ Last modification time of the event (as a
      -- RFC3339 timestamp).
    summary Text Maybe -- ^ Title of the event.
    description Text Maybe -- ^ Description of the event.
    location Text Maybe -- ^ Geographic location of the event as free-form
      -- text
    colorId Text Maybe -- ^ The color of the event. This is an ID
      -- referring to an entry in the event section of the colors definition
      -- (see the colors endpoint).

    -- EventStart
    startDate Day Maybe -- ^ The date, in the format "yyyy-mm-dd", if this is an
      -- all-day event.
    startDateTime UTCTime Maybe -- ^ The time, as a combined date-time value
      -- (formatted according to RFC3339). A time zone offset is required unless
      -- a time zone is explicitly specified in timeZone.
    startDateTimeTimeZone TimeZone Maybe -- this field stores TimeZone
      -- information that is otherwise lost when converting ZonedTime to
      -- UTCTime. TimeZone is a distinct value from the timezone system that
      -- Google Calendar uses, which is the field below. Most Calendar entries
      -- will only have Datetime values.
    startTimeZone Text Maybe -- ^ The time zone in which the time is specified.
      -- (Formatted as an IANA Time Zone Database name, e.g. "Europe/Zurich".)
      -- For recurring events this field is required and specifies the time zone
      -- in which the recurrence is expanded. For single events this field is
      -- optional and indicates a custom time zone for the event start/end.
